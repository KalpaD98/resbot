      # here lets have a check point
      # possible other intents are
      # user_wants_to_change_restaurant_booking_date, user_wants_to_change_booking_num_people, user_wants_to_change_both_restaurant_booking_date_and_num_people
      # if they wants to change both we can throw the restaurant_booking_change_form and ask to fill both values
      # after user fills this we can run an action to check the values again (some basic checking) for all 3 cases
      # then we give another action to make a comparison between previous and current booking values
      # in above action we ask are you sure to change this booking
      # if yes we run action_change_restaurant_booking_details
      # if no -> well handle it later

      # this is example stories for booking a restaurant from scratch
